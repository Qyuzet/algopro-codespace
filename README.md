# AlgoPro Codespace

This repository contains Python scripts for the Algorithm and Programming course. It includes various programming exercises and examples.

## Contents

The repository contains the following Python scripts and folders:

1. `W2-calculator.py`: A scientific calculator with a graphical user interface using Tkinter.
2. `W3-morse.py`: A Morse code generator that converts text to Morse code.
3. `W4-function.py`: Examples of custom functions for list operations and string manipulation.
4. `W6-bimay-quizz.py`: A simple class management system for lecturers, classes, and students.
5. `W5-classes/`: A folder containing scripts related to object-oriented programming:
   - `circle.py`: Defines a Circle class with methods for color and circumference.
   - `myself.py`: An empty file (possibly for future use).
   - `player.py`: An empty file (possibly for future use).

## Requirements

To run these scripts, you need:

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

No additional libraries are required beyond the Python standard library.

## Usage

To run any of the scripts, use the following command in your terminal:

```
python <script_name>.py
```

For example:

```
python W2-calculator.py
```

### Script-specific Usage

1. W2-calculator.py:
   - Run the script to open the calculator GUI.
   - Use the buttons to perform calculations.

2. W3-morse.py:
   - Run the script and enter a word or phrase when prompted.
   - The program will output the Morse code equivalent.

3. W4-function.py:
   - The script demonstrates two custom functions with examples.
   - Run the script to see the output of these function calls.

4. W6-bimay-quizz.py:
   - The script sets up a simple class management system.
   - Run the script to see the predefined lecturers, classes, and students.

5. W5-classes/circle.py:
   - This script defines a Circle class with methods for getting color and calculating circumference.
   - To use it, you can import the Circle class in your own Python scripts or run it directly to see the example usage.
